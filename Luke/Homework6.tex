\section*{4.3}

A DFA will recognize $\Sigma^*$ iff every reachable state is a final state. In a similar fashion to Theorem 4.4, we design the TM T to test whether or not this is the case and decide $ALL_{DFA}$.\\\\
T = ``On input A, where A is a DFA:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mark A's start state
    \item Do until no new state is marked:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mark any state that can be reached via the transition function from a marked state
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If every marked state is a final state, then \textit{accept}; Else any marked state is not a final state, then \textit{reject}.''
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4.4}

Every CFG has an equivalent Chomsky Normal Form. The rules of a Chomsky Normal CFG state that the only way to generate the empty string is through the rule $S \rightarrow \epsilon$. Using this fact, we design a TM T to decide $A\epsilon_{CFG}$.\\\\
T = ``On input G, where G is a CFG
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Convert G to a Chomsky Normal Form G' with rules R'
    \item If the rule $S\rightarrow \epsilon$ is in R', then \textit{accept}; Else \textit{reject}.''
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4.11 (using a CFG)}

We construct a TM I to decide $\textrm{INFINTE}_{PDA}$. \\\\
I = ``On input M, where $P=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,F)$ is a PDA that recognizes $L(P)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Construct a Context Free Grammar for $L(P)$, $G'=(V',\Sigma',R',S')$
    \item Convert $G'$ into Chomsky Normal Form grammar, $G=(V,\Sigma,R,S)$
    \item Conduct a search for recursion in the rules, $R$
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Use a BFS to prevent ``getting stuck", as opposed to DFS
	\item For some arbitrary non terminal $A \in V$, if the derivation $A \rightarrow uAv$ exists, for $u,v \in \{ V \cup \Sigma \}^*$, then recursion exists in the rules
    \end{itemize}
    \item If recursion is found \textit{accept}; Else \textit{reject}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4.11 (shaky)}

We construct a TM I to decide $\textrm{INFINTE}_{PDA}$. \\\\
I = ``On input M, where $P=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,F)$ is a PDA that recognizes $L_P$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $k = |\mathscr{P}(Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon)|$
    \item Construct DFA, D, to recognize $L_D = \{ w \;\; \bigr | \;\; |w| > k \}$
    \item Construct DFA, M, to recognize $L_M = L_D \cap L_P$
    \item Use the $E_{DFA}$ decider Theorem 4.4 and \textit{reject} if $L_M = \emptyset$; Else \textit{accept} if $L_M \neq \emptyset$
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Required:} For a PDA to accept an infinite number of strings, there cannot exist an upper limit on the length of the strings the PDA accepts, ie, it must accept strings of arbitrary length. \\\\
Our PDA has a transition function $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\epsilon \Gamma_\epsilon \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon)$. Therefore, at any time, the PDA may be in any of $|\mathscr{P}(Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon)|$ different configurations of state and stack. We choose the integer $k$ to be this size. We build a language $L_D$ that contains all words longer than $k$. Using $L_D$, we build another language $L_M$ that contains the elements in the language recognized by our PDA $L_P$ that are longer than $k$. If the language of the PDA $L_P$ contains no words longer than k, then $L_M$ will be empty and our TM will reject. If $L_P$ contains some word longer than $k$, we accept because that word may be pumped with the pumping lemma for CFGs, meaning that the PDA will accept an infinte number of strings. 

\section*{5.1}

First we define
\begin{align*}
    EQ_{CFG} &= \{ <G_1, G_2> | G_1 \textrm{ and } G_2 \textrm{ are equivalent context free grammars} \}\\
    ALL_{CFG} &= \{ <G> | G \textrm{ is a CFG and } L(G) = \Sigma^* \} 
\end{align*} 
We will use a proof by contradiction to show that $EQ_{CFG}$ is undecidable.\\\\
Suppose that $EQ_{CFG}$ were decidable by some TM, R. Then we could use R to construct a TM, S, that decides $ALL_{CFG}$. We describe S in the following paragraph.\\\\
On input G, where G is a CFG:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $<G, G_{\Sigma^*}>$ on R, where $L(G_{\Sigma^*}) = \Sigma^*$
    \item \textit{accept} if R accepts; Else \textit{reject}
\end{enumerate}
In summary, machine S uses machine R to compare an input grammar, G, to a grammar whose language is $\Sigma^*$. The result of R's computation then determines if $L(G) = \Sigma^*$.\\\\
However, we know from Theorem 5.13 that $ALL_{CFG}$ is undecidable. Therefore, we have a contradiction and $EQ_{CFG}$ cannot be decidable.

\section*{5.4}

No.\\\\
We revisit the definition of mapping reducibility. If $A \leq_m B$, then there is a computable function $f$ where
$$w \in A \textrm{  iff   } f(w) \in B$$
$f$ is defined such that some Turing Machine, on input $w$, halts with the output $f(w)$ on its tape. \\\\
However, just because the function $f(w)$ produces strings that belong to the regular language B does not nessecitate that the input strings $w \in A$ form a regular language themselves. So A does not need to be regular for B to be regular.\\\\
For further evidence, we provide a counter example. Suppose A is context free language with an alphabet $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$. If we map all members of A to 1 and all non members of A to 0, then $A \leq_m B$ where B is a regular language with one member: the single character '1'.

\section*{5.9 (incomplete)}

First we define
\begin{align*}
    T &= \{ <M> | M \textrm{ is a TM that accepts } w^R  \textrm{ whenever it accepts } w \}\\
    A_{TM} &= \{ <M, w> | M \textrm{ is TM and accepts } w \} 
\end{align*} 
We will use a proof by contradiction to show that $T$ is undecidable.\\\\
Suppose that $T$ were decidable by some TM, R. Then we could use R to construct a TM, S, that decides $A_{TM}$. We describe S in the following paragraph.\\\\
On input $<M, w>$, 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do stuff. Not sure what tho.
\end{enumerate}
However, we know that $A_{TM}$ is undecidable. Therefore, we have a contradiction and $T$ cannot be decidable.

\section*{5.22 (shaky on ltr)}

We will prove 
$$
\textrm{A is Turing-recognizable} \leftrightarrow A \leq_m A_{TM}
$$

\subsection*{left-to-right direction}
We will prove
$$\textrm{A is Turing-recognizable} \rightarrow A \leq_m A_{TM}$$
If A is Turing recognizable, then some TM $T_A$ recognizes it. We design a TM $T$ that writes the concatenation of a word, w, and $T_A$ on its tape if $T_A$ accepts w. We describe the TM $T$:\\\\
On input w:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run w on $T_A$
    \item If $T_A$ accepts, write $<T_A, w>$ on the tape and accept. Else write the empty string.
\end{enumerate}
We see that every word in $A$ gets mapped to $<T_A, w>$, ie, some member of $A_{TM}$.
This fulfils the mapping reduction from $A$ to $A_{TM}$.

\subsection*{right-to-left direction}
We will prove
$$A \leq_m A_{TM} \rightarrow \textrm{A is Turing-recognizable}$$
We know from theorem 5.28 that if $A \leq_m B$ and B is Turing-recognizable, then A is Turing recognizable. $A_{TM}$ is a Turing-recognizable language, thus A must be as well.
