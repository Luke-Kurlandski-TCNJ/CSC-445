We describe $D$ more simply
$$D = \{w \big | w \textrm{  is a word with an odd number of } b \textrm{'s followed by an even number of } a \textrm{'s} \}$$
And construct a DFA that recognizes $D$

\section*{1.40 b}

Suppose the language $A$ is regular. Then we can construct an NFA $N$ that recognizes $A$. We can apply a simple modification to $N$ to have it recognize $\textrm{NoExtend(A)}$. Since $\textrm{NoExtend(A)}$ is recognized by an NFA, lets call it $N'$, it is regular. Therefore, the class of regular languages is closed under the $\textrm{NoExtend()}$ operation.\\\\
Given the NFA $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ that recognizes $A$, we construct $N' = (Q', \Sigma', \delta', q_0', F')$ that recognizes $\textrm{NoExtend(A)}$ where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q' = Q \cup \{q_f\}$ : we add one additional state to $Q$ and make it the one and only final state.
    \item $\Sigma' = \Sigma$ : we keep the same alphabet.
    \item $\delta' = \delta \cup \delta_\textrm{new}$ : we keep all of the old transitions but add some new ones. Out of every state, we add a arrow for every letter in $\Sigma$ that the state did not already have leaving it. This arrow then leads to $q_f$. This causes the automata to enter the accept state as soon as it reads a character that confirms the string is not a substring of any word accepted by $N$.
    \item $q_0' = q_0$ : we keep the same start state
    \item $F' = \{q_f\}$ : we make the set of accept states our new state.
\end{itemize}
