\section*{2.30}

We will prove L is not a context free language using a proof by contradiction and the Pumping Lemma.
$$L = \{ t_1\#t_2\#...\#t_k | k \geq 2, t_i \in \{ a, b\}^*, \exists ( t_i = t_j,  i \neq j ) \}$$
Suppose L is a CFL. Then for a string $s \in L$ of length greater than p, there exists some decomposition of s, $s = uvxyz$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $uv^ixy^iz \in L$ for $i \geq 0$
    \item $|vy| > 0$
    \item $|vxy| \leq p$
\end{enumerate}
We let $s = $ because $|s| \geq p + 1$ and $s \in L$.\\\\

On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Move the head to the front of the tape. Scan the tape and mark the first 1 that has not been marked. If none are found, move to stage 5.
    \item Move the head to the front of the tape. Scan the tape and mark the first 0 that has not been marked. If no 0 is found, reject. 
    \item Scan the tape and mark the first 0 that has not been marked. If no 0 is found, reject.
    \item Go to stage 1
    \item Move the head to the front of the tape. Scan the tape to see if any unmarked 0s remain. If none remain, accept, else reject.

\subsection*{b}
Suppose we have Turing Machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ that decide languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the concatenation of $L_1$ and $L_2$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $M_1$ on the first portion of w 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_1$ enters an accept state $w$, begin stage 2
        \item If $M_1$ does not accept, reject
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Run $M_2$ on the remaining portion of w.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_2$ accepts, then accept
        \item Else, reject
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{c}
Suppose we have a Turing Machine $M$ that decides the language $L$. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the language $L^*$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $M$ on w. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If w is empty, accept
        \item If $M$ enters an accept state, repeat stage 1 at the current point on input string
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{d}
Suppose we have a Turing Machine $M$ that decides the language $L$. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the language $L^c$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $M$ on w. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M$ accepts, then reject
        \item Else accept
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{e}
Suppose we have Turing Machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ that decide languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $M_1$ on w 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_1$ accepts, continue to stage 2
        \item Else reject
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Run $M_2$ on w
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_2$ accepts, accept
