\section*{2.15 Matthew}
The construction of G' from CFG G = (V, $\Sigma$, R, S) for the CFL A by adding the new rule S → SS fails to prove that the class of context-free languages is closed under star because G' can not guarantee that just the empty string $\epsilon$ is produced. This is because we do not know if the rule S → $\epsilon$ (or some equivalent derivation) exists  and the resulting set from the Kleene star operation must always contains $\epsilon$. 

\section*{2.30 Matthew}

We will prove L is not a context free language using a proof by contradiction and the Pumping Lemma.
$$L = \{ t_1\#t_2\#...\#t_k | k \geq 2, t_i \in \{ a, b\}^*, \exists ( t_i = t_j,  i \neq j ) \}$$
Suppose L is a CFL. Then for a string $w \in L$ of length greater than p, there exists some decomposition of s, $s = uvxyz$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $uv^ixy^iz \in L$ for $i \geq 0$
    \item $|vy| > 0$
    \item $|vxy| \leq p$
\end{enumerate}

We let $w = a^pb^p\#a^pb^p$ because $|w| \geq p + 1$ and $w \in L$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since there must be two terms equal to each other and we only have two terms, both sides of $\#$ must be equal to each other.
    \item Since there must always be at least two terms, $v$ and $y$ cannot include the delimiter $\#$ because choosing i = 0 would mean there is no delimiter $\#$ and therefore only one term.
    \item If $v$ and $y$ were both on one side of the delimiter $\#$ then it would fail for every $i \neq 1$ since then $t_1 \neq t_2$. Therefore $x$ must contain the $\#$ delimiter and $v$ is to the left of it while $y$ is to the right
    \item $v$ must contain only $b$'s and $y$ must contain only $a$'s since if either has both then the other cannot be on the other side of the delimiter $\#$ since there are $p$ number of $b$'s before the delimiter $\#$ and $p$ number of $a$'s after and $|vxy| <= p$.
    
    Therefore you will be left with the string $a^p b^q \# a^r b^p$ which means for every $i \neq 1$ that $t_1 \neq t_2$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{b Matthew}
Suppose we have two Turing machines $TM_1$ and $TM_2$ that that decide the languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. To determine that the class of decidable languages is closed under concatenation we construct a new machine $TM_c$ that copies the input onto its tape and then inserts a delimiter $\#$ at the start of the tape. We then 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $TM_1$ on all of the input to the left of the delimiter $\#$ and $TM_2$ on all of the input to the right of $\#$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If both machines accepts, $TM_c$ accepts the input as part of $L_1 \circ L_2$
        \item Else move the delimiter $\#$ one position to the right, copying the symbol that was there to $\#$'s old position
        \item If we've reached the end of the input and just copied $\#$ onto an empty tape symbol, then $TM_c$ rejects the input as not being part of $L_1 \circ L_2$
        \item Else go back to step 1
    \end{itemize} 
    
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{c Both}
Suppose we have a Turing Machine $M$ that decides the language $L$. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the language $L^*$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run M on w from the first unmarked cell onward
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If there are no unmarked cells remaining accept
        \item Mark the current cell of the tape
        \item If M enters an accept state, repeat stage 1. Else if M enters a reject state, then reject.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{d}
Suppose we have a Turing Machine $M$ that decides the language $L$. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the language $L^c$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $M$ on w. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M$ accepts, then reject
        \item Else accept
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{e}
Having proved that decidable languages are closed under union and complement, DeMorgan's Law proves they are closed under intersection as well (as seen in other classes of languages).\\\\
Suppose we have Turing Machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ that decide languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. We describe the Turing Machine $M'$ that decides the intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$.\\\\
On input string $w$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $M_1$ on w 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_1$ accepts, continue to stage 2
        \item Else reject
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Run $M_2$ on w
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_2$ accepts, accept
        \item Else reject
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
